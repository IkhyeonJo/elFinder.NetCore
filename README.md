# elFinder.NetCore

## Instructions

1. Install the NuGet package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/elFinder.NetCore/

## Credits

**elFinder.NetCore** is based on my [fork](https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.Net) of [elFinder.Net](https://github.com/leniel/elFinder.Net) by Leniel Macaferi which itself was based on an [older version](https://github.com/EvgenNoskov/Elfinder.NET) by Yevhen Noskov, which as far as I can tell is the original.
